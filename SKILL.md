# Honest Feedback Framework

Deliver difficult feedback with directness and humanity, prioritizing the recipient's growth over their comfort.

---

## When to Use

- Giving performance feedback to a colleague or employee
- Critiquing creative work
- Telling a friend something they don't want to hear
- Addressing problems in a relationship or team
- Reviewing or evaluating work product
- User asks "How do I give honest feedback?" or "I need to tell someone something they won't want to hear" or "How do I critique without being cruel?"

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| feedback | Yes | What you need to communicate |
| recipient | Yes | Who you're talking to |
| relationship | No | Your relationship and history |
| context | No | Why this feedback matters now |
| stakes | No | What happens if nothing changes |

## Bourdain's Kitchen Philosophy

Anthony Bourdain learned to give and receive feedback in professional kitchens—high-pressure environments where sugarcoating gets people hurt and standards matter. His approach balances brutal honesty with genuine care.

### The Core Principles

**1. Directness Is Respect**
Hedging, softening, and dancing around the point wastes everyone's time and insults the recipient's intelligence. If something matters enough to say, say it clearly.

**Not this:** "I think maybe there might be some room for improvement in certain areas..."
**This:** "The sauce broke. Here's why. Here's how to fix it."

**2. Speed Matters**
Feedback delayed is feedback diluted. Address problems immediately while the context is fresh and the behavior can actually change.

**Kitchen rule:** If something's wrong during service, you say it now—not in a meeting next week.

**3. Focus on the Work, Not the Person**
The dish failed. The project has problems. The execution didn't meet standards. This isn't about whether someone is a good person—it's about whether the work is good.

**Not this:** "You're careless and don't pay attention."
**This:** "The vegetables are overcooked. Every time. We need to fix that."

**4. Assume Capacity**
If you're giving feedback, it's because you believe the person can do better. Otherwise, why bother? Honest feedback is an investment in someone's growth.

**The unspoken message:** "I'm telling you this because I think you can handle it and improve."

**5. Don't Soften to the Point of Uselessness**
The "compliment sandwich" (positive-negative-positive) often buries the actual message. If the feedback is important, don't hide it.

**Exception:** When someone is genuinely fragile and the relationship matters more than the immediate correction.

## The Framework

### Step 1: Be Clear About What Happened
State the specific behavior, result, or problem. No generalizations, no interpretations—just what you observed.

*Template:* "Here's what I saw: [specific observation]."

### Step 2: Be Clear About the Impact
Why does this matter? What were the consequences? What's at stake?

*Template:* "Here's why it matters: [specific impact]."

### Step 3: Be Clear About the Standard
What should have happened? What's the expectation? Where's the bar?

*Template:* "Here's what we need: [specific standard]."

### Step 4: Be Clear About the Path Forward
How can they improve? What support is available? What happens next?

*Template:* "Here's how to fix it: [specific action]."

### Step 5: Affirm Your Investment
Make it clear this feedback comes from a place of believing in them.

*Template:* "I'm telling you this because [reason you care about their success]."

## Tone Calibration

Match the severity to the stakes:

| Stakes | Tone | Example |
|--------|------|---------|
| Low (minor issue, easy fix) | Light, quick | "Hey, the margins are off. Mind fixing?" |
| Medium (pattern forming, needs attention) | Direct, serious | "This is the third time this week. We need to talk about what's going on." |
| High (significant failure, job/relationship at risk) | Firm, caring | "This isn't working. I need to be honest with you about how serious this is." |

---

## What Honest Feedback Is NOT

| It's Not | It Is |
|----------|-------|
| Cruelty dressed as honesty | Truth delivered with purpose |
| Venting your frustration | Communicating what needs to change |
| Proving you're right | Helping them improve |
| Public humiliation | Private correction |
| Attack on character | Assessment of work/behavior |
| One-way lecture | Opening for dialogue |

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Feedback Approach: [Situation]

### What Happened (Observation)
[Specific, factual description]

### Why It Matters (Impact)
[Consequences, stakes, why this needs to be addressed]

### The Standard (Expectation)
[What should happen, what the bar is]

### The Path Forward (Action)
[How to improve, what support is available]

### The Investment (Care)
[Why you're telling them this, what you believe about their capacity]

### Delivery Considerations
- Setting: [Where to have this conversation]
- Timing: [When to have it]
- Tone: [How direct to be]
- Follow-up: [What comes after]
```

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations
1. [Action 1]
2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| Insufficient input data | Request specific additional information needed for analysis |
| Ambiguous requirements | Ask clarifying questions before proceeding |
| Conflicting constraints | Highlight the conflicts and ask for prioritization |
| Out of scope request | Explain the skill's boundaries and suggest alternatives |
| Incomplete analysis | Acknowledge limitations and indicate what additional inputs would help |

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "My direct report keeps missing deadlines on important projects. I've hinted at it but nothing changes. How do I address this?"

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Feedback Approach: Missed Deadlines

### What Happened (Observation)
"In the last month, three deliverables have come in late: the client report (two days), the budget review (one week), and the project plan (three days). In each case, you didn't flag the delay until after the deadline had passed."

### Why It Matters (Impact)
"When deadlines slip, the whole team has to scramble. The client report delay meant Sarah had to cancel her evening plans to finish the presentation. The budget delay pushed back our quarterly planning. And when I don't know something's late until after, I can't help or adjust—I just get surprised."

### The Standard (Expectation)
"I need two things: First, if a deadline is going to slip, tell me at least 24 hours before, not after. Second, I need to understand if these deadlines aren't realistic, or if something else is going on. Either way, we need to solve it."

### The Path Forward (Action)
"Let's do two things: First, walk me through what's happening with your workload. I want to understand if you're overcommitted or if there's something blocking you. Second, let's set up a quick check-in mid-week so we can catch problems earlier. I'd rather help you a few days before than scramble afterward."

### The Investment (Care)
"I'm being direct because you're too good for this to keep happening. You do excellent work when you deliver. I want to help you deliver consistently, because that's what's going to get you where you want to go."

### Delivery Considerations
- **Setting:** Private, one-on-one, not over Slack
- **Timing:** Monday morning, fresh start to the week
- **Tone:** Serious but not angry—this is a problem-solving conversation
- **Follow-up:** Check in at the end of the week to see if the new approach is working

## The Bourdain Caveat

Bourdain's kitchen directness worked because of context:
- Clear hierarchy
- Shared commitment to quality
- Immediate consequences
- No time for bullshit

In other contexts, calibrate. A line cook can take "that's garbage, remake it." A friend sharing their first novel draft needs different handling.

**The principle remains:** Honest feedback is a gift. Soft-pedaling to the point of uselessness helps no one. But how you deliver it should match the relationship and stakes.
